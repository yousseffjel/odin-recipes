        <li>4 ¼ cups bread flour (500 grams)</li>
        <li>1 rounded teaspoon dry yeast (3.5 grams)</li>
        <li>1 ½cups plus 3 tablespoons water (400 ml)</li>
        <li>generous1 ½ tablespoons olive oil (20 ml), plus 2 teaspoons more to oil container</li>
        <li>rounded 1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt or kosher salt (10 grams)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pizza</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup diced sweet peppers and onions</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups prepared pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For dough, mix together flour, yeast, and water with a wooden spoon until almost all flour has disappeared
            and a rough dough is formed. </li>
        <li>Add salt and olive oil and continue mixing with a spoon for about 3 minutes until a smooth, very soft and
            sticky dough forms. Clean off spoon and scrape down bowl. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Perform first set of rotating folds: leaving dough in the bowl, with a damp hand, reach under and grab the
            dough at the edge of the bowl, pull it and stretch it over the top. Rotate the bowl a few inches and repeat
            about 10 or 12 times, then gather the dough into a ball as best you can, turning the smoothest side up.
            Cover the bowl, and let dough rest for 15 minutes. Repeat this stretch, fold, and rest process 2 more times.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer dough into an oiled container with a lid, rub dough with a few drops of olive oil and cover.
            Refrigerate for 24 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to the counter. With damp hands press and stretch dough into a square about 15 inches wide.
            Fold in half, and then in half again to create a rectangle. Fold rectangle into thirds, and turn over so the
            seam side is down.</li>
        <li>Shape back into a neat ball with damp hand. Transfer dough into an oiled container, rub with a few drops of
            olive oil, and cover. Refrigerate for an additional 24 hours or until doubled in size. </li>
        <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and let stand on the counter for 1 hour to come to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare toppings: Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly,
            breaking up any clumps with a spatula, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan; set aside to cool. Add red
            peppers and onions to the same skillet, and cook and stir just until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes;
            remove and set aside. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (250 degrees C). Oil a sheet pan generously with olive oil. A sheet of
            parchment paper can be place</ul>d on the pan to prevent sticking. </li>
        <li>Transfer dough to the prepared sheet pan. Use oiled fingers to press dough into a rectangle that almost
            covers the pan. If dough is too elastic to stay in place, let it rest for a minute, and then continue
            stretching and pressing into place.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over dough and brush to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza crust to a cooling rack to
            cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Remove parchment from pan if used, then return crust to the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce, scatter over sausage and vegetables, sprinkle with mozzarella and Monterey Jack
            cheese, and finish with a dusting of Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are well browned, about 15 minutes. Remove to a cooling rack; let
            cool for 10 to 15 minutes, then cut and serve.</li>
    </ol>
